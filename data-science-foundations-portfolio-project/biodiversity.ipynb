    "Project Scoping is the helpfull beggining of the project. It helps to recognise and line up the structure while requiring you to think through your entire project before you begin. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the National Park Service aims to preserve at-risk species and maintain biodiversity within their parks, the primary objectives as an analyst will be to understand the characteristics of these species, their conservation status, and their relationship to the national parks. Some of the key questions to explore include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
    "- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "As a project for a fictional customer there is no need to scope actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Codecademy has provided two `csv` files filled fictional data but inspired by real information. \n",
    "The first `species_info.csv` file has information about each species and another `observations.csv` has observations of species with park locations. This data will be used to analyze the goals of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will utilize descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques to gain a deeper understanding of the data. Statistical inference will also be applied to determine whether the observed values are statistically significant. Key metrics to be calculated include: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Distributions\n",
    "1. Counts\n",
    "1. Relationship between species\n",
    "1. Conservation status of species\n",
    "1. Observations of species in parks. "
