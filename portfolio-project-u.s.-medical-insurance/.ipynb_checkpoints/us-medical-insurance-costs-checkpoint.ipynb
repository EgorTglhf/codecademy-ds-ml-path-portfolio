    "In the beggining we had the dataset with records of different insurants. We loaded it to specially organized lists. Right after we started analysis and wondered the first several questions. Then we implemented proper functions which helped us to find answers. Answers only inspired us to make another seria of questions. And then again we implemented proper functions to find answers interested us. That what we have after our work:\n",
    " * The average age of insurants equals 39.0 years with the standart deviation 14.0 years and it looks like people with different ages buy insurance\n",
    " * The most insurants are from the Southeast region and their amount equals 364. But there are a lot of insurants from other regions either and the difference is not large and equals 39-40 insurants\n",
    " * Your habbits can extremaly increase the cost of insurance if you are a smoker. Averagely not-smokers pay 8434.0 US dollars for the insurance and smokers pay 32050.0 US dollars and it is 23616.0 US dollars more! But the cost not essentially depends on you are male or female and equals 13957.0 and 12570.0 US dollars respectively.\n",
    " * The average age of insurants who are parents equals 40.0 years and it is just a little more than the average age of all insurants which equals 39.0 years. Interesting to note that from insurants there are more parents and their amount is 764 when insurants who are not-parents only 574."
